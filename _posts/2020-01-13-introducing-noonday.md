Today, I'm excited to give you a sneak peek at a project I've been working on for a while now. It's an application that's designed to make planning, managing, and recording your daily activities easier and more efficient than ever before. I'm calling it **Noonday**.

### Backstory

I first began developing Noonday early last summer. By that time, I had tried a number of methods for keeping track of my schedule, including:

- Paper planners
- To-do list apps such as Todoist
- Google Calendar
- Plain old notebooks

Each one had serious shortcomings. Paper planners and notebooks were a burden to carry around, they made it hard to edit things, and I found writing out events and tasks by hand to be somewhat distracting. Todoist, meanwhile, was great for organizing to-dos but terrible for visualizing blocks of time. Google Calendar proved to be the strongest contender and has been my system of choice while I've been getting Noonday off the ground. Still, it's pretty basic, the mobile app is slow, and the glitchy Tasks interface leaves a lot to be desired.

Dissatisfied with all of the available options and in need of a capstone project for my senior year of high school, I resolved to create my own calendar application.

### Development

Believe it or not, before this project I had never used a JavaScript framework, despite being well-versed in jQuery and vanilla JS. I played around with a couple before settling on [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), a lightweight and surprisingly intuitive framework whose users [reportedly include Apple, Google, and Nintendo](https://medium.com/notonlycss/google-apple-and-other-users-of-vue-js-e4505359e5d5).

I plan on using [Google Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions/) for the app's backend.

### Features

Here are some of the features that will distinguish Noonday from similar applications:

#### Custom Algorithmic Scheduling

Write your own code to define when events occur in as much complexity as you'd like.

#### Travel Times

Automatically compute and display travel times alongside events. For example, see how long it will take you to get from work to dinner without leaving the app.

#### Unscheduled Time Queries

Search for periods of unscheduled time within a broad range of parameters.

### Timeline

The web app is set to launch in April 2020. If all goes well, a mobile app should follow sometime this summer.

That's all for now. Thanks for reading, and stay tuned for more updates!
