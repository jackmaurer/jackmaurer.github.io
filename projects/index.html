<h2>Projects</h2>

<p>Here are some things I've built or am currently building.</p>

<h3>
  <a href="/projects/noonday.html">Noonday</a>
</h3>
<p>Right now, I'm working on a cross-platform calendar application that's going to have lots of useful features you won't find in leading calendar apps. It's tentatively scheduled for release in April 2020. Until then, you can read the latest updates <a href="/projects/noonday.html">here</a>.</p>

<h3>
  <a href="https://crosswordtiles.web.app">Crossword Tiles</a>
</h3>
<p>Since early 2019, I've been developing a browser-based version of the popular word game Scrabble&reg; with the ultimate goal of using it for AI experimentation. Although the game isn't currently stable, you're welcome to play around with what I have so far <a href="https://crosswordtiles.web.app">here</a>.</p>

<h3>
  <a href="/2020/01/05/nine-card-golf.html">Nine-Card Golf in Python</a>
</h3>
<p>In January 2020, I wrote a command-line version of a card game called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_(card_game)#Nine-card_golf">nine-card golf</a>. You can read all about it in <a href="/2020/01/05/nine-card-golf.html">this blog post</a> or explore the source code <a href="https://github.com/jackmaurer/nines">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Virtual Genetics Lab</h3>
<p>In December 2019, I wrote a web app for simulating genetic crosses. I'll have a link to it up soon.</p>

<h3>
  <a href="https://github.com/jackmaurer/websocket">Python WebSocket server</a>
</h3>
<p>In May 2017, I wrote a Python package for creating servers in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket">WebSocket protocol</a>. You can find the source code repository <a href="https://github.com/jackmaurer/websocket">here</a>.</p>
