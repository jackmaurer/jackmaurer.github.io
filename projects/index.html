<h2>Projects</h2>

<p>Here's a list of things I've built or am currently building.</p>

<h3>Noonday (Coming Soon)</h3>
<p>Right now, I'm working on a cross-platform calendar application that's going to have lots of useful features you won't find in leading calendar apps. I'll be posting more about it soon!</p>

<h3>Crossword Tiles</h3>
<p>Since early 2019, I've been developing a browser-based version of the popular word game Scrabble&reg; with the ultimate goal of using it for AI experimentation. Although the game still has a few bugs, you're welcome to play around with what I have so far <a href="https://crosswordtiles.web.app/">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Nine-Card Golf in Python</h3>
<p>In January 2020, I wrote a command-line version of a card game called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_(card_game)#Nine-card_golf">nine-card golf</a>. You can read all about it in <a href="/2020/01/05/nine-card-golf.html">this blog post</a> or explore the source code <a href="https://github.com/jackmaurer/nines">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Virtual Genetics Lab</h3>
<p>In December 2019, I wrote a web app for simulating genetic crosses. I'll have a link to it up soon.</p>

<h3>Python WebSocket server</h3>
<p>In May 2017, I wrote a Python package for creating servers in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket">WebSocket protocol</a>. You can find the repository <a href="https://github.com/jackmaurer/websocket">here</a>.</p>
